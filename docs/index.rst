plugin-template Plugin
======================

The ``plugin-template`` plugin extends `pulpcore <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pulpcore/>`__ to support
hosting plugin-template packages.

If you are just getting started, we recommend getting to know the :doc:`basic
workflows<workflows/index>`.

How to use these docs
---------------------

The documentation here should be considered **the primary documentation for managing Python
content**. All relevent workflows are covered here, with references to some pulpcore supplemental
docs. Users may also find `pulpcore's conceptual docs
<https://docs.pulpproject.org/en/3.0/nightly/concepts.html>`_ useful. Here, the documentation falls
into two main categories:

  1. :ref:`workflows-index` show the **major features** of the plugin-template plugin, with links to
     reference docs.
  2. `REST API Docs <restapi.html>`_ are automatically generated and provide more detailed
     information for each **minor feature**, including all fields and options.
